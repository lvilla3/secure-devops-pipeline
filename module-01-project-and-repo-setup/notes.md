This folder contains my notes and pipeline for the lab: Configure a Project and Repository Structure to Support Secure Pipelines.

# Module 01: Configure Project and Repository Structure for Secure Pipelines

## ‚úÖ What I Did
- Created a new Azure DevOps project for secure pipeline management
- Set up two repositories: `eShopOnWeb` and `eShopSecurity`
- Configured repository permissions to enforce least privilege access
- Linked service connections for secure deployment
- Created and committed a YAML pipeline definition with variables and resource references
- Verified successful CI/CD pipeline execution using the new structure

## üîê Why It Matters
This lab established a secure foundation for future DevOps workflows. By separating repositories and managing access, I ensured:
- Operational control over deployment environments
- Reusability of pipeline definitions across projects
- Security through scoped permissions and service connections

## üß† What I Learned
- How to structure Azure DevOps projects for security and scalability
- The role of service connections in secure deployments
- How YAML pipelines can be reused and parameterized
- How to enforce access control at the repository level

## üì∏ Screenshots
- Azure DevOps project creation
- Repository structure and permissions
- Pipeline definition and successful execution
